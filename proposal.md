Star Ranger Run

## Repository

## Description
Star Ranger Run will be a runner-minigame where the player plays as a cowbow on a little dinosaur whilst dodging random land & sky obstacles. This minigame will challenge player to think quickly about their actions and also have fun!

## Features
- Feature 1
	Animated sprite; I will be creating simple art assets for the minigame
- Feature 2
	Audio queue for jumping and certain score milestones; I will need to figure out how to implement sound queues in my game
- Feature N 
	"Moving platform"; I will program a moving track containing obstacles where a collision could end the game

## Challenges
- implementing sprites for character animation
- implementing sound
- implementing moving platform

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally would like to have a sound and moving game that also keeps score. I may include a "finish line"/end screen after a certain score or succesfully find a way to keep the game infinite.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- At minimum, I would like a visual game where I need to jump over obstacles.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Start implementing basic character movement and structure of the minigame
  2. Implement score system

- Week 2
  1. Test random filler-pngs for 'character'
  2. Create character sprites(at least 4?) and art assets(background, platform, land & sky obstacle)

- Week N (Final)
  1. Implement background music
  2. Try to implement score win/lose sound effects
