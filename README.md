## Description
For my PDFA final, I created a runner-minigame where you play as a cowboy on a little dinosaur and will have to dodge over random land & sky obstacles. This minigame will challenge players to think quickly about their actions and have fun whilst exploring this strange world.
For my first sprite game, I am somewhat proud of the final result and feel less intimidated by spriting. Something I can improve on in the future is to set time aside and add more elements to the game, such as a cutscene.
